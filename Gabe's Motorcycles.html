    <h1> Gabe's vintage motorcycle collection. </h1>
        <p> In all seriousness, motorcycles and bikes are a rather large part of my life. I spend a lot of time in my garage back home building, restoring, and selling vintage motorcycles. I have a particular liking to the classic enduro types of bikes.
           I have even brought one of my motorcycles to ride around campus. Unfortunately, I often have to sell many bikes to make room for more. But this has given me the oppurtunity to own a lot of cool bikes.
           One day in the future, I hope to own my own business where I can use my skills and passion of motorcycles.
